      <h1>Car Brand History</h1>
      <p>The automotive industry began in the 1860s with hundreds of manufacturers that pioneered the horseless carriage.
      For many decades, the United States led the world in total automobile production. In 1929, before the Great Depression,
      the world had 32,028,500 automobiles in use, and the U.S. automobile industry produced over 90% of them. At that time
      the U.S. had one car per 4.87 persons. After World War II, the U.S. produced about 75 percent of world's auto production.
      In 1980, the U.S. was overtaken by Japan and then became world's leader again in 1994. In 2006, Japan narrowly passed the
      U.S. in production and held this rank until 2009, when China took the top spot with 13.8 million units. With 19.3 million
      units manufactured in 2012, China almost doubled the U.S. production, with 10.3 million units, while Japan was in third
      place with 9.9 million units. From 1970 (140 models) over 1998 (260 models) to 2012 (684 models), the number of automobile
      models in the U.S. has grown exponentially. </p>

		<p>
		Land Rover is a british car manufacturer that specializes in manufacturing of “premium” class vehicles. Since 2008, owned by Indian company Tata Motors and included in to the Jaguar Land Rover group.


		The creators of the first Land Rover car were the chief designer of the british company Rover – Maurice Wilkes and his brother, Executive Director – Spencer Wilks. As a prototype for the new SUV, American Willys was used.

		In the early postwar years the Rover company achieved from the government permission for production of civilian cars and had a complete new plant Meteor Works in Solihull.

		Maurice Wilkes believed that this car was an ideal “switch-over” model, which would help to the Rover company to survive. Soon Maurice Wilkes titled the car “Land Rover”.

		In Autumn of 1947 the first complete prototype – “Centre Steer” appeared. Prototype body was painted with green colour. Engine and transmission were taken from passenger car models of Rover.

		In spring 1948 Land Rover was introduced at the car show in Amsterdam. Rover Company was surprised by unexpectedly huge interest to this model. Land Rover didn’t become a “switch-over” model, as it was supposed to be by Wilkes brothers.

		In the 1960s the demand for SUVs greatly increased and Land Rover was one of the leaders in this new market segment. Rover engineers sat down to design a new vehicle that combine comfort and driving performance of a family car with off-road Land Rover capabilities.

		Their work produced a Range Rover, launched into production in 1970. The famous design of this model achieved a unique level of recognition, being exhibited in the Louvre. In addition to the unique comfort, the car had an outstanding off-road performance.

		In 1990 Land Rover was renamed to Defender.

		In the late 80’s Land Rover introduced another world premiere. New model Discovery was first shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 1989, this car created a new niche – a comfortable family car with excellent off-road performance 4×4.

		At the mid-90′ Range Rover was a standard of all-terrain vehicle in “luxury” class. In 1994 a new company owner BMW made its radical renewal.

		In 1997 Freelander was presented. It was a more compact car, oriented toward the use in port and recreation. It took the lead in Europe by sales volume in the 4×4 class.

		And in the end of 2002 Land Rover started production of New Range Rover.

		In spring 2004, Land Rover introduced a completely new model of the Discovery 3.
